Aquarius Meeting Notes
======================

- Alerts that send messages via SMS to more than one person.  Example: battery voltage or Gauge Height:
	- Alert is sent for arbitrary reasons
		- high/low points
		- missing data
	- Alert can be muted: if a reciever can't respond they need to be able to ignore.
	- Alert can be routed to other receivers.

- We need to see TimeSeries data graphs and missing data

- Need to allow customer to download data via csv or other standard readable format.

- Display multiple sensors on the same graph.  No need to jump from one graph to another.

- Hard time parsing:
"Does Web Portal Interface ... Picture ".  I can't quite parse this, but I think that we want to combine a timeseries (graph?) with a picture.   
> need clarification
- Current meter measurements
> also need clarification

- Web Portal Only gater data from AQTS?
	I think the answer is yes.  The webportal only gathers the data from the webportal.

	However, we need to talk details.  There is a possibility that we can get other data from DCS tool kit into AQTSM. 

	Let's talk details, there may be a solution.

- We'll create accounts for Brandon, Steve and Chris.

- Let's identify the accounts we currently want to support, I believe we can replace some accounts if needed.

We can most likely get data from radio sites into the webportal into the AQTSM, we just need to talk specifics, but I'm sure we can make that happen.
