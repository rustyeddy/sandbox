Style Guide for Python Scripts
------------------------------

Style guides are key to keeping work consistent amoung a project. One thing to bear in mind is that code is read many more times that it is written.  Therefore it should be written with readability in mind.  For that reason, this style guide exists.

Basically we'll follow the official Python style guide [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)

I don't want to be pedantic about style, but the following are important and will be _strictly_ enforced :)

* Indentation: use spaces (not tabs)
* Indentation level: 4 spaces
* Wrap code at 80 characters
* New lines between logical block are good (for readability)
